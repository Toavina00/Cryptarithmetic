# Cryptarithmetic Problem

Verbal arithmetic, also known as alphametics, cryptarithmetic, cryptarithm or word addition, is a type of mathematical game consisting of a mathematical equation among unknown numbers, whose digits are represented by letters of the alphabet. The goal is to identify the value of each letter. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic)

Traditionally, each letter should represent a different digit, and (as an ordinary arithmetic notation) the leading digit of a multi-digit number must not be zero. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic)
